There are also some other common words such as he is el, she is ella, and spanish is espanol. When you combine these words, they combine just like the english alphabet so if you wanted to say “I am in spanish” you would just translate the words where you would say “Yo soy en espanol.” In spanish there is also conjugation where you can’t say “El soy” in spanish, which is very similar to English as people don’t say “he am”. However people do say “he is” where in spanish it translate the same where you would say “El es”. Almost everything in spanish translate the same from sentence to sentence at the beginning so when doing your translations make sure to do just translate each word as you go by."
