Welcome to your first lesson in Spanish fundamentals! Here, we'll explore the Spanish alphabet, learn some essential phrases, and touch upon the important concept of verb conjugation.

The Spanish Alphabet:
• The Spanish alphabet officially contains 27 letters. It has one more letter than the English alphabet: Ñ (eñe). Each letter is pronounced very differently, and mastering these pronunciations is crucial for speaking the language correctly.

Basic Spanish Vocabulary and Phrases:
• Spanish contains some words that have clear equivalents to English, which can help in learning:
    • I is yo
    • In is en
    • Is is es (from the verb &quot;ser,&quot; used for more permanent characteristics or identities)
    • Am is soy (also from the verb &quot;ser&quot;)
    
Other useful things to learn:
• He is él (note the accent mark)
• She is ella
• Spanish (the language) is español (lowercase 'e' unless it begins a sentence).
• Forming Simple Sentences (and Where Caution is Needed)
• When you combine these words, they form sentences, but it's important to understand that Spanish sentence structure is not always a direct word-for-word translation of English.

Understanding Conjugation;
In Spanish, there is also verb conjugation, which means verbs change their form to match the subject. This is similar to how we speak in English.

• For example, in English, we don't say &quot;he am.&quot; Instead, we say &quot;he is.&quot; This is a form of conjugation.

The same scenario applies in Spanish:

You cannot say &quot;Él soy&quot; (which would be like saying &quot;he am&quot;).
However, people do say &quot;he is,&quot; which translates to &quot;Él es&quot; in Spanish.
Almost everything in Spanish translates, but not always word-for-word, especially when it comes to verbs. While you might find initial sentences seem to translate closely, it's essential to learn the correct verb forms and sentence structures as you go."
